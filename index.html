    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Caramelize the onions:</em> Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions, sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deeply golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Add the thyme and cognac:</em> Stir in the thyme to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes. Pour in the cognac and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, until reduced by half and allowing the alcohol to evaporate and the flavors to meld. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Cook the pasta:</em> Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of the pasta water, then drain the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Prepare the sauce:</em> In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, remaining salt, and black pepper. Gradually add the reserved pasta water to the mixture until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Combine everything:</em> Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the caramelized onions. Pour the sauce over the pasta and toss to combine, ensuring the noodles are well coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Serve:</em> Divide the pasta among serving plates and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and thyme if desired. Bon appetite!
